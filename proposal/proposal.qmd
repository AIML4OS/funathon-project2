## Data

Two possibilities:

- Use our open data from the registry.
- Generate synthetic data in English using `llm.lab` ("generate me plausible codes for code XX ") and sample using real label distribution from our data.

Nice task for Matéo Morin (intern) who arrives in February and will be working on synthetic data.
The generation process would not be part of the subject but will be disclosed for interested readers.

## Goal

- Task 1: Understand how to train and optimize a `torchTextClassifiers` classifier with overview of different features: custom tokenizer, explainability (a supervised learning approach):
  - Step 1:  from data preprocessing/splitting
  - Step 2: model training and (small) grid search
  - Step 3: log and promote a wrapper on MLFlow
  - Step 4: deploy a model using an API
- Task 2: Understand a simple RAG system (a few-short learning approach)
  - embed a text
  - analyse the retrieval
  - prompt engineering

One notebook for each - independent but that should be done "sequentially".

# Tools

- TTC package for supervised text classification (based on PyTorch and Lightning - deep learning frameworks)
- llm.lab API for RAG, as well as some `qdrant` for vectorial database
- Python
