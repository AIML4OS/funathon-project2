## Data

- One choice is to use our data open data from the registry.
- Otherwise, we will generate synthetic data in English using `llm.lab` ("generate me plausible codes for code XX ") and sample using real label distribution from our data.

Nice task for Matéo Morin (intern) that arrives in February and will be working on synthetic data.
The generation process will not be part of the subject but will be disclosed for interested readers.

## Goal

- Understand how to train and optimize a `torchTextClassifiers` classifier with overview of different features: custom tokenizer, explainability (**a supervised learning approach**):
  - start from data processing/splitting
  - show how to choose right hyperparameters via grid search - we release the weights to avoid retraining
  - log and promote a wrapper on MLFlow
  - no GPU needed, unless for advanced users that want to train themselves the model (request needed) 

- Understand a simple RAG system by building it, step-by-step (**a few-short learning approach**)
  - embed a text
  - analyse the retrieval
  - prompt engineering
  - some batched calls to llm.lab will be involved

One notebook for each - independent but that should be done "sequentially". Utils functions will be imported from _*.py_ files.

# Tools

- TTC package for supervised text classification (based on PyTorch and Lightning - deep learning frameworks)
- llm.lab API for RAG, as well as some `qdrant` for vectorial database
- Python
